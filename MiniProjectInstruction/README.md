## 🔍 Project Components  
Your mini-project must include the following sections:  

### 1️⃣ Load the Dataset and Explore Basic Information  
- Open and inspect the dataset  
- View the first few rows to understand its structure  
- Check for missing data and data types  

### 2️⃣ Perform a Descriptive Summary of the Dataset  
- Calculate basic metrics (mean, median, standard deviation)  
- Identify trends (e.g., average values)  
- Detect any unusual values or outliers  

### 3️⃣ Perform a Time-Based Analysis  
- Group data by time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly)  
- Identify trends, peaks, or seasonal patterns  

### 4️⃣ Visualize Data  
- Create meaningful graphs and charts to present insights  

### 5️⃣ (Optional) Predictive Analysis  
- If you missed more than 2 hands-on exercises, you can compensate by doing a predictive analysis  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
- Use variables to predict outcomes (e.g., regression-based predictions)

## 📂 Dataset Selection  
- **Choose a dataset that aligns with your career path** (e.g., business, marketing, finance, healthcare, cybersecurity).  
- **You cannot analyze the same dataset as another participant** unless you are in the same group.  
- If working individually, ensure your dataset is unique.  
- **Find a list of recommended datasets in the attached PDF.**
